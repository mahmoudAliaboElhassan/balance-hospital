## Why this project?

Hospitals need more than a simple schedule:

- structure (categories → departments),
- clear doctor classification (scientific + contracting),
- controlled roster lifecycle (status + validation),
- request workflows (approve/reject),
- notifications to keep everyone updated,
- reports (including Excel export),
- and a dashboard to access everything quickly.

Balance Hospital brings these into one organized system.

---

## Roles (Multi-Role Supported)

The system is permission-based and supports users having more than one role at the same time.

Common roles:

- **Admin (System Administrator)**
- **Category Manager**
- **Department Manager**
- **Doctor**

Examples of supported combinations:

- Doctor + Department Manager
- Department Manager + Category Manager
- Doctor + Category Manager

> Pages and actions are automatically shown/hidden based on the user’s role & permissions.

# Who Can Do What (Responsibilities)

### Admin (System Administrator)

✅ Full access to the entire system:

- Manage all categories, departments, degrees, shift hours, rosters, users, roles/permissions
- View and manage all reports across all categories/departments
- Full notifications and auditing visibility

---

### Category Manager

✅ Manages **everything inside their assigned category**:

- Manage rosters for that category:
  - create new rosters
  - manage roster status
  - manage roster data and operations
- Handle doctors related to the category:
  - approve/reject doctor status for the category
- Leaves management for that category:
  - view leave requests
  - approve/reject doctor leaves
- Reports (category scope):
  - view category reports
  - export reports to Excel
- Departments:
  - view departments linked to that category

> Category Manager access is limited to their category scope, not the whole hospital.

---

### Department Manager

✅ Manages **their department only**:

- View roster data for **only that department** across all months
- Select which category the department belongs to **in that specific month** (when applicable)
- View department calendar:
  - doctor schedule
  - shifts / working hours
- Download department schedule data as **Excel**
- Manage department GeoFences (if enabled):
  - view and manage department geofences

> Department Manager does not manage other departments or categories outside their department.

---

### Hybrid (Multi-Role User)

✅ Can act as Category Manager and/or Department Manager depending on preference.

- After login, hybrid users can choose the mode they want to operate as:
  - **Act as Category Manager**
  - **Act as Department Manager**

This keeps workflows clean and prevents mixing responsibilities accidentally.

---

### Doctor

✅ Minimal access (lowest access level):

- Only sees their own schedule / assignments / status
- Receives notifications about approvals/rejections and schedule updates
- The main system focus is on **managers**, while doctors primarily use the **mobile application** for day-to-day interaction

---

## Access Control (Guarded Pages)

The UI is protected so users only see and access what matches their role and permissions:

- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- Admin-only areas are restricted to admins
- Each feature page is protected by required permissions
- Unauthorized access shows a clear “Forbidden / Not Allowed” experience

---

## Best Practices (Code & Architecture)

(Kept here to avoid cluttering the main description.)

- **Custom hooks** keep feature logic reusable and UI clean
- **Guards** ensure feature pages match permissions and role
- **Single source for routes + sidebar** to prevent mismatched navigation
- **Consistent approve/reject flows** across requests and leaves
- **Notification-first UX** so users always know what changed
- **i18n-ready UI** (multi-language) + consistent formatting across languages
- **Theme-ready UI** (dark/light mode) across main pages

---
